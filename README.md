# Introduction 
This project represents our attempt of the 2020 Aktuarvereinigung Data Science Challenge, which can be
found here https://github.com/DeutscheAktuarvereinigung/Data_Science_Challenge_2020_Betrugserkennung.
The challenge is to predict whether a certain customer of an insurance is handing a fraudulent claim to the
insurance for an alleged car-accident.

# Getting Started
1.	This project is using a pipfile with all the used packages and versions

# Build and Test
Given that the code is relatively little, the code is mainly in the main.py file. In order for
the bigger functions not to impact readability, functions are put into the functions file. Given
that substantial trainings-time was necessary, the trained algortihm is then saved as well in the folder

# Contribute
There is a lot to try out and to be done. Feature Engineering for example. So far there aren't that many
potentially useful features created, but the creativity and time is lacking to find many more. Furthermore,
different up/ down-sampling mechanisms could be tried for the problem
